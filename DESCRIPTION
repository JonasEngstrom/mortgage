Description: Calculate monthly costs and time required to pay off a mortgage in
    Sweden. The package also provides functions for calculating potential
    advantages and disadvantages of making the minimum required payments towards
    the principal while investing the money in an index fund instead to later
    pay off the principal as a lump sum.
